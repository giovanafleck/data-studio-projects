Hi! 

For this project, I began analyzind a series of reports from the Amazon Fund. In total, I had 10 pdfs. My main problem was that all 
tables in the reports didn't have any line delimitator for the columns. After a few tries in Tabula, and some suggestions from my mentor, 
I decided to insert the lines mannually - only in the tables that interested me. After that, I could read them and work 
with the data inside my data frame. 

With that, I began plotting the levels of deforestation over the years for each Brazilian region where the legal part of the Amazon
Forest is located. 

After that, I joined all the regions to compera the increseas and decreses. All the graphs were edited in Illustrator, to correct
colors and texts. 

I also wanted to map it, so I created a new data frame with the coordinates and exported it into a CSV to edit all in QGIS. 
I combined it with another dataset from the reports and found out where deforestation is incrising and where the Fund in 
investing in projects. 

With the map, I started working on my reporting as a complementary thing, to asnwer some questions like: 
- Why deforestation peacked on the mid-90s and again in early 2000s? 
- Why there are projects outside of Amazon? 
- What is the criterea to invest in projects? 
- How much the Fund is contributing to decrease deforestation in Brazil? 
- How much the country could loose (in terms of money and enviromental policy) if the Fund was extinct? 

In the end, I set it all into the html page.
